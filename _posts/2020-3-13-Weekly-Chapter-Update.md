<p><strong>MARCH 22 GBM WILL BE REMOTE -- Health security message from MDC DSA </strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Steering Committee</strong>
</p>
<p>The Steering Committee of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America takes the safety, health, and well-being of our members and larger community very seriously. <strong><em>We have decided that the March 22, 2020 General Body Meeting will be held virtually.</em></strong> We will additionally be working with working group and campaign leaders to make the chapter Zoom account available to those working groups that wish to hold meetings remotely so that they can take similar precautions.
</p>
<p>At this point the situation is rapidly changing, but the DC City Government has declared both a state of emergency and a public health emergency. As part of that emergency, public health officials have advised all large public gatherings be canceled. While this technically does not apply to most MDC DSA events, as “large public gathering” is defined as greater than 1,000 people, we are out of abundance of caution recommending against in-person meetings, when possible, at this time. Given the importance of our organizing work, we will be making tools available to make sure organizing can occur remotely.
</p>
<p>We are closely monitoring the situation with the spread of coronavirus and will continue to act. We will be consulting with the latest guidance from public health authorities and<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/guidance-community-faith-organizations.html"> the CDC guidelines for community and faith organizations. </a>
</p>
<p>The Steering Committee also asks that all comrades who feel ill to take care of themselves by staying at home and resting. If possible, they should feel free to participate remotely in organizing, but for their own safety--and the safety of their comrades--should not attend in-person events. We encourage all members to wash their hands frequently and follow all CDC advice.
</p>Finally, as socialists we must note two things. First, some on the right, including the occupant of the Oval Office, have attempted to use the coronavirus to spread xenophobia and racism. We reject xenophobia and racism and stand in solidarity with those communities being demonized, maligned, or scapegoated. Second, the potentially devastating impact of the coronavirus has been exacerbated by the United States’ for-profit healthcare system. Healthcare is a human right. Public health services are a public good. Many working class people lack access not only to healthcare, but paid sick leave. The decision to prioritize the profit and greed of a few over the needs of the many endangers everyone. Our fight for a socialist future is all the more urgent.

<p>AS THE DMV PREPARES (SORT OF) FOR COVID-19...
</p>
<p>Our comrades at DC Jobs with Justice want to remind you that as a worker in DC you are entitled to paid sick leave. Don’t let any boss -- yours or those of others -- get away with claiming otherwise:
</p>
<p><strong>In the face of an emerging public health crisis</strong> it is important to remember your rights as a worker. <strong>EVERY worker in DC</strong> (full-time and part-time) <strong>has a right to paid sick days</strong>. If you work in DC and have accrued paid sick leave <strong>your boss can NOT:</strong>
</p>
<p>❌ Require that you work
</p>
<p>❌ Require you to take unpaid leave
</p>
<p>❌ Require that you find someone to cover your shift
</p>
<p>❌ Require documentation for paid sick leave of less than 2 consecutive days
</p>
<p>❌ Retaliate against you for calling in sick
</p>
<p>Don't let your boss cheat you out of your rights! Email nikko@dcjwj.org if you or someone you know has been denied paid sick days!
</p>

<p><strong></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Publication Schedule</strong>: Since we published <a href="https://mdcdsa.org/the-washington-socialist/metro-dc-dsa-washington-socialist-for-march-2020/">the March issue of the <em>Washington Socialis</em>t</a>, we have published two articles, one on <a href="https://metrodcdsa.org/washington%20socialist/International-Women-s-Day-1934/">the deep radical roots of International Women’s Day</a> and the second on <a href="https://metrodcdsa.org/washington%20socialist/Feeling-the-Bern-in-Nova/">the recent Bernie Sanders appearance in Northern Virginia</a>. Though they were published early because of their timeliness, both will be in the table of contents for our April issue of the <em>Washington Socialist</em>, as well.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two  Friday Updates remain for March &mdash; March 20 and 27. The above-mentioned April issue of the <em>Washington Socialist</em> monthly newsletter will be emailed Friday, April 3. Article deadline for that issue is Saturday, March 28. Lots is happening on every front in our lives, from very mass to very individual. <em>How can you </em><strong><em>not</em></strong><em> write?</em> (see image of pointing finger).
</p>
<p>Like all our working groups, the Pubs WG needs pitch-in from members: writing on subjects close to our socialist hearts (including what your WG/caucus/campaign has been doing or plans to do); editing, design, creating ‘zines and one-off flyers for our work, and doing website work to keep our MDC DSA profile dynamic. So<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScONi3oG9Na-aryyNamf4LKT2narCC84Lee8QVowGduYP3iIg/viewform"> fill out our contributor’s form</a> and we’ll be in touch. We need your help to spread socialist ideas and news about the chapter’s work. <strong>We have scheduled a work session</strong> to get experience with our two new platforms – a new website and new chapterwide email launcher – <strong>Saturday, March 14</strong>. For details see our #publications Slack channel.
