</p>
<p><strong>FRONTLINING: Fight for Climate Action - join Extinction Rebellion and Metro DC DSA for a presentation on the climate crisis and direct action training</strong>
</p>
<p>Spring is here and it is time to act! <em>Join Metro DC DSA and Extinction Rebellion at the Shaw neighborhood library in the WTD meeting room Sunday March 22nd from 1:30 to 4:30 PM</em> to learn about the climate crisis followed by a direct action training. All are welcome! Get up to speed or get a quick refresher on the science behind the climate crisis before getting plugged into the Earth Day to May Day climate strikes [See also Allies calendar].
</p>
<p>The planet is in ecological crisis: we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. Scientists say what's required to avoid the existential threat of climate and ecological collapse is rapid and unprecedented changes, not unlike the total mobilization carried out in response to the Second World War. Members of the global movement Extinction Rebellion will share the latest climate science on where our planet is heading, discuss some of the current psychology around climate change and ecological breakdown, and offer solutions that led previous social movements, like the U.S. civil rights movement, to success.
</p>
<p>Members of Metro DC DSA will briefly discuss the need to use our collective power and all of the tools at hand to fight for an ecosocialst Green New Deal. Confronting the climate crisis offers an opportunity to lift up everyone, especially those most impacted and yet least responsible for the climate crisis, as we create a just, equitable future. To do this, we must break down the racist, imperialist capitalist system that led us to this world of skyrocketing inequality and climate breakdown.
</p>
<p><span></span>Then we act. Seasoned activists involved with ShutdownDC will cover the basics of working together in a small group (affinity groups), moving in the streets together, how to plug in with the action framework, your legal rights and what to do if you're arrested, and staying healthy and safe in the streets! If you're planning on joining us in the streets this spring, we'd strongly encourage you to make sure that you and the folks you're planning on hitting the streets with participate in a training. Everyone is welcome and there will be time to ask questions and discuss throughout the presentations.
</p>
<p>AGAIN:  Sunday March 22nd, Shaw neighborhood library WTD meeting room 1:30pm to 4:30pm
