</p>
<p><em>Feb 22: Huntington Canvass</em><br>
</p>
<p>-------Accomplished-----------
</p>
<p>Over 100 canvassers met up. We officially blew past our updated goal of knocking 15,000 doors in Virginia! Last Saturday alone we touched nearly 5,800 voters. Close to 20 bi-lingual, Spanish-speakers. Pic of the crowd <a href="https://twitter.com/PatNorthrup/status/1231660863569965057/photo/1" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">HERE</a>.

<p><em>Feb 25: South Carolina Debate Watch Party</em>
</p>
<p>-------Accomplished-----------
</p>
<p>Once again DSA Bernie supporters descended on Penn Social(ist), in Penn Quarter to cheer on Bernie Sanders during the final debate before Super Tuesday. Nearly 70 comrades saw Bernie ably articulate to Democratic voters in South Carolina, and around the country, why he is the only candidate that will dominate the Millionaires and Billionaires and finally win the class war in the U.S. for working people. Pic of the troops still watching even at the tail end of the debate <a href="https://twitter.com/human_dsa/status/1232501588108902400/photo/1" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">HERE</a>.

If the DC Council reauthorizes our current bare-bones legislation without adopting the Reclaim Rent Control platform, the DC Council will once again be voting against tenants. Join us and the Reclaim Rent Control coalition of 40+ organizations to show Ward 1 Councilmember Brianne Nadeau what we really want&mdash;better, stronger rent control now! The event will be at <strong>3435 Holmead Place NW</strong>, a rent-controlled building whose current conditions show just how inadequate our rent control laws are. Residents have been on rent strike since December against bad conditions (mice, bed bugs, mold) and bad management (UIP). CM Nadeau will get a tour from residents&mdash;let's rally with them to show her that her entire ward supports them and wants her to introduce a better bill, now!

<p><strong>ATU Local 1764 reaches Tentative Agreement with Transdev at Fairfax Connector, averts strike</strong>
</p>
<p><em>MDC DSA members have spent lots of solidarity time on the line with TransDev workers during their long strike. Here is the latest on the hiccup in the post-settlement negotiations, from ATU.</em><span></span>
</p>
<p><em>Fairfax, VA </em>– Averting what would have been the second strike in less than three months, ATU Local <strong>1764 </strong>has reached a tentative agreement with private contractor Transdev that covers the operators and maintenance workers at the Fairfax Connector. Their tentative agreement includes improvements to healthcare along with substantial wage increases.
</p>
<p>“We are happy to report that we have reached a tentative agreement with Transdev that recognizes the hard work and commitment of our more than 600 bus drivers and maintenance workers,” said ATU International President John Costa. “I am proud of these workers and the solidarity, resolve and unity that they have shown during their December strike and the last few months, which was critical to securing the fair and just contract that they deserve.”
</p>
<p>After almost three more months of fruitless contract negotiations with Transdev, the for-profit foreign corporation picked by the County to administer the Fairfax Connector service for a profit, more than 600 Fairfax Connector workers began to prepare for a second possible strike. This came after the Fairfax Connector workers' four-day strike last year against the multinational private transportation company as the strike by ATU Local 689 Transdev workers at WMATA’s Cinder Bed Road facility was taking place. During both strikes, the workers received strong support from riders, allies and elected officials.
</p>
<p>“We’d like [to]  thank our riders, union allies, community advocates and elected officials for their unwavering support since our fight for workplace justice and a fair contract began,” Costa continued. “This is a victory not only for our workers, but our riders and community. This shows that Together We Fight, Together We Win!”
</p>
<p>Further details about the tentative agreement will be released following the vote by Local 1764 Fairfax Connector members.

<p><strong>Next </strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/mdcdsa/events/268710970/"><strong>Labor Working Group meeting</strong></a> is TONIGHT (Friday FEB 28) at 6:30pm at 1616 P St NW, Suite 150. We'll be going over the Virginia labor law reform efforts, our organizing campaigns, get sorted with LWG tech tools and more. See MDC DSA calendar below.
</p>
<p>Also, <strong>the fight for health justice in SE</strong> continues. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiCFa_ekhzatkBMk9SjCHsKSRwPJsd6Lq5wyx3ZGn7nkNPyg/viewform?link_id=1&can_id=31ce6cf7b5277e8aecdd09aaf88b146a&source=email-petition-build-a-world-class-hospital-in-southeast-2&email_referrer=email_732380&email_subject=petition-southeast-residents-deserve-a-world-class-hospital">Sign on</a> to demand that the residents of SE DC get a new world class hospital and not some glorified urgent care center. <br><br><strong>Further alert from the Labor WG:  March 5th Safeway workers will take a strike vote.</strong> This could potentially lead to a region-wide strike of grocery workers, something that has not happened in quite a while. We will be gathering information of Labor Working Group and DSA members so we can gauge where our strengths are geographically to support the 20 stores in the immediate DC area. <a href="https://forms.gle/baVu2uZaw241LZKs6">Sign up here for a store</a> and if you are interested in being a "store captain" that will be the primary point of contact and the person who will orient DSA members on the picket line. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The major sticking point is that Safeway, owned by Albertson's which is in turn owned by the blood-sucking hedge fund Cerberus,<a href="http://www.ufcw400.org/2020/02/25/safeway-continues-to-refuse-to-fund-pension/"> is refusing to fund the pension of these workers. All jobs deserve to be jobs you can retire on, and these workers have one of the best retirement</a> plans in the area for retail workers. That can only be preserved through this struggle. <a href="https://forms.gle/baVu2uZaw241LZKs6">Sign up so we know how</a> many people we can count on to stand with UFCW members on the picket lines at Safeway. <em>-- Sam N</em>
