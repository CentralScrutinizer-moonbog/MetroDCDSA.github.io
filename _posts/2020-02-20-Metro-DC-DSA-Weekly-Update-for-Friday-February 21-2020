</p><br><br>
<p>EARLY NEXT WEEK an important collaboration with allies: The DC Tenants Union will be doing a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/mdcdsa/events/268828938/">special canvass on Tuesday, September 25th</a> at 6pm, and Stomp Out Slumlords, one of MDC DSA‚Äôs most thriving campaigns, is organizing to join them. Meet at the LEDC office at 1401 Columbia Road NW, Unit C-1 (the basement) and canvass in neighborhood, where a number of people live at UIP-managed buildings -- one of the biggest offenders for abusing loopholes in rent control laws. <strong>Do you live at a UIP-managed building? We would love to see a </strong><strong>ton</strong><strong> of UIP tenants from across the city at this event.</strong> -- email <a href="mailto:tenants@mdcdsa.org">tenants@mdcdsa.org</a>

<p><em>From Union City yesterday (Thursday) morning:</em>

</p>
<p>Giant settles; Safeway strike possible
</p>
<p>Hundreds of union Safeway employees, members of UFCW Locals 400 and 27, yesterday rallied alongside elected officials, community leaders and other allies, telling management to negotiate a fair contract or face a strike. At the same rally, however, Giant workers announced they had reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, averting a potential work stoppage. ‚ÄúThe promise of a union job was that we won‚Äôt get rich but we will be able to provide health care for our families,‚Äù said Safeway member Jane St. Louis. ‚ÄúBut now, Safeway wants to break that promise.‚Äù Union members will meet on March 5th, announced UFCW 400 president Mark Federici. [The two mega-chains have 25,000 union members in the region.] Giant members will vote on whether to ratify their new collective bargaining agreement, while Safeway members will vote on whether to authorize a strike. ‚ÄúThe countdown starts today,‚Äù Federici said. ‚ÄúThe countdown for justice ends March 5th.‚Äù<a href="http://out02.thedatabank.com/?r=MTAwMg0KSjQxNDY2OC1DMzY2LU0yNjAwNzMtLW13YWNhZG1pbg0KMzcxNTYzNjYxMjMzODMwMDc4ODkzMjYwMDczMTEwDQoxMmIwMDAwMDAyODYzMTENCmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudWZjdzQwMC5vcmcvMjAyMC8wMi8xOS9zYWZld2F5LXdvcmtlcnMtYW5ub3VuY2Utc3RyaWtlLXZvdGUtbWFyY2gtNS8NCnNhZmV3YXl3b3JrZXJzYW5uDQp3b29kbGFuaGFtQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ%3d%3d"> <em>Read more here</em></a>

<p><strong>MDC DSA 4 BERNIE UPDATE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>--Accomplished! </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Saturday Feb 15</strong><strong>th </strong><strong> Canvass in East Falls Church</strong> ‚Äì Record number of doors knocked yet! Over 80 volunteers (including Spanish-English bi-lingual folks) knocked on a record-breaking 4,100 doors despite freezing cold temperatures and a technical snafu. Photos<a href="https://twitter.com/Kurtis91H/status/1228859810621329410"> HERE</a>. Afterward we ate, drank, and gabbed at a local beach bar.
</p>
<p>Did you canvass with us and forget to sync your data? You still can on the MiniVan app! Go into the app and tap the cloud+arrow icon in the upper righthand corner of your phone screen.
</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday Feb 18</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> Working Group Meeting</strong>: Nearly thirty (30!) Bernie enthusiasts joined together at the MDC DSA HQ in Dupont Circle to plot our next moves toward putting Bernie in the White House this year. We assigned tasks for upcoming events like the Sat 22nd canvass, GOTV carpooling, 3/3 Super Tuesday Evening Watch Party, and the 3/15 Univision Arizona Dem Debate. 
</p>
<p>Do you want to volunteer for a special role for one of our upcoming events? <em>We need you! </em>Email us at <a href="mailto:DSA4Bernie@mdcdsa.org">DSA4Bernie@mdcdsa.org</a> to find out what roles still need filling!

<p><strong>Sat Feb 29</strong><strong>th</strong><strong>: Post-GOTV celebration & South Carolina Election Returns Watch Party!</strong>
</p>
<p>After a full day on the doors talking to Bernie supporters about their Super Tuesday voting plans (see below for info about carpools to canvasses), we deserve food, drink, and fun&hellip;and to watch South Carolina vote for Bernie as their top Democratic choice, and pave the way for Bernie to capture a Super Tuesday victory just days later. 
</p>
<p>We‚Äôll likely meet at Courthaus Social in Clarendon. Please note that it‚Äôs (very!) highly encouraged that you bring proof that you canvassed or phonebanked  that day for Bernie in Virginia!
</p>
<p><strong>&lt;&lt;GET. OUT. THE. VOTE. ü°™ Feb 23-March 3&gt;&gt;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Super Tuesday, the largest election day in the primary, is March 3</strong><strong>rd</strong> <strong>in Virginia</strong>. If you haven‚Äôt knocked doors for Bernie in Virginia by then, you‚Äôve officially slept through the revolution. Get Out The Vote, or GOTV, is the ground-game for turning out Bernie supporters to the polls on election day. 
</p>
<p>For GOTV, we are asking people to canvass with the <em>official</em> campaign. <strong>We are organizing carpools for the 29th:</strong> If you need a ride or have a car and can provide rides, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfukEyAWvrL03G49TFYuwgXrK0wh3Biqd0NgF5PnnMv0yyOpA/viewform">this form</a> and we‚Äôll plug you into our system. Be sure to recruit your friends to join you! Also, participate in as many other GOTV canvasses as possible. Email us at <a href="mailto:dsa4bernie@mdcdsa.org">dsa4bernie@mdcdsa.org</a> if you have any questions.
</p>
<p><em>Note: We can‚Äôt coordinate with the official campaign behind the scenes, but we </em>can<em> post about their public events. Keep us on the right side of election law and please don‚Äôt share nonpublic info between us and the official campaign!</em>

<p>A national group looking to bring sex work decriminalization to ballot is facing opposition from local sex worker activists. Many want nothing to do with the group because one of its founders was accused of sexual misconduct during time as a marijuana advocate. The local activists also are suspicious of the predominantly white national organization, arguing that black, Latino and transgender women bear the brunt of anti-prostitution laws. And they worry a defeat at the ballot box could hurt their cause if local lawmakers see constituents rejecting decriminalization.<br><br>
